### Overview
“Clock-in” is a workforce management solutions web application used to, digitize time tracking and attendance, optimize scheduling to meet work demands and labor laws compliance, manage and control cost of labor, keep inventory of equipment and provide data for performance analysis and forecasting. However, this application will focus primarily on tracking employee’s time and attendance: specifically for cdl drivers who must work within the department of transportation’s regulations of hours of service. 
This app will automate monitoring of employees attendance and total hours of work, thus eliminating the need for manual time clock punching in. This app will allow employees to clock in and out, allow employees to check their hours worked from previous week. This app will refuse employees in violation of hours of services ability to login without consultation and permission of the terminal manager/compliance department. Other than tracking employee time and attendance, this application will also keep track of issuance and expiration date for driver’s license and D.O.T physical card as aspect compliance.
